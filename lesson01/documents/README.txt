Project Proposal: Interactive map to plot travel routes
API: Google Maps API
Details:
- Create an interactive interface for travelers to drop pins and provide brief descriptions of attractions / restaurants worth going to in cities they have visited
- Plots an ideal / suggested route for visiting travelers based on criteria provided: starting location, mile radius, preferred activities (ie museums, bars, parks, etc), time of day, journey duration, and possibly more

I travel frequently for work and for fun and always spend so much time plotting routes to see a city and visit the best places. I would have loved to have something like this, especially if it could be made available offline (I know maps has this feature). Also, I would like to make it interactive and get input from others to make it social/more interesting. I am passionate about travel and would like to build a complete travel website after completing this program.
